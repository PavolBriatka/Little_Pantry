# Little_Pantry

Project in progress, written in Kotlin only

<p>I started with this project in the summer 2019. It is supposed to be a practice project to improve
my understanding of Dependency Injection with Dagger2, working with Firebase components 
(Firestore, Authentication, Storage, etc.) and Jetpack Navigation Component.</p>
<p>I'm also experimenting with Animations and Transitions using shared elements and custom UI components.</p>
<p>I'm aiming for MVVM architecture with elements of MVI architecture using RxJava and LiveData.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b><br>google-services.json file not provided for security reasons. If you want to run the app you need to create a new firebase project and import your own config file</p>
